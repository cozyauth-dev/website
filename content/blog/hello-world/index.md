I started working on Cozy Auth about a year ago. The original goal was to create an open source alternative to auth0 and similar services, but with a clear focus on Passkeys. But the market is crowded with VC backed startups like Clerk, Hanko or Supabase. A common wisdom in the indie hackers community says, you should not pick a large crowded market like this, but instead look for a market that is to small for big tech and VC backed startups. So I changed my mind and followed [Rob Walling's Stair Step Method of Bootstrapping](https://robwalling.com/2015/03/26/the-stair-step-method-of-bootstrapping/). My new strategy became focusing on Supabase Auth, which did not provide support for Passkeys. Building a Passkey extension for Supabase Auth sounded like a great strategy to make step one.

But I got distracted. I started learning Rust (I don't regret it ðŸ˜‰). I lost the focus on what I actually wanted to build. So I parked Cozy Auth for a while and started working on my [Cozy Coder](https://cozycoder.app/) project instead. But I need authentication there as well!

That's why I restart the Cozy Auth project now. But this time with 3 very clear goals:

1. Build it for myself
2. Validate, if it is useful for others
3. Validate, if there is a working business model
## The Sidecar Approach
Probably the biggest change is that building a SaaS product is no longer the goal. Instead Cozy Auth will be designed to run as a sidecar next to a web application. That's how I want to use it for Cozy Coder and that's how you will be able to use it as well.

{{ resize_image(path="blog/hello-world/sidecar-setup20250105104015.png", width=600, height=0, op="fit_width") }}

To make this approach work well, it is crucial to keep the runtime footprint of the sidecar as low as possible. This will be achieved by:

- Let Cozy Auth use a separate schema in the same Postgres as your web application.
- Minimize the CPU and memory usage of Cozy Auth by writing it in Rust.

Ideally, nobody recognizes the Cozy Auth sidecar due to its low footprint.
## Commercial Open Source
As Cozy Auth started with a SaaS business in mind, the project has been a commercial open source project from the beginning and will stay like this. But there are no current plans to build a SaaS product at the moment.

Instead I draw inspiration from [Sidekiq](https://sidekiq.org) and [once.com](https://once.com). Sidekiq is an open source project, but there is also a pro version of the software with some extra features like observability. To use the pro version, you have to purchase a license. But different to Sidekiq, I prefer a licensing model, where you pay once.

The features I consider for the pro version are observability and support for multiple relying parties for Passkeys.

Of course, a commercial open source project has some benefits compared to sponsoring or donations for financing the project. That's why it is important that companies, who make money by using the software, have an opportunity to pay for the development.
